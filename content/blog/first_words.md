### "There's something delicious about writing those first few words of a story. You can never quite tell where they will take you."

#### Beatrix Potter (2006 Movie)

&nbsp;

The world of education is its own little microcosm, isn’t it? Education has its own language, usually in the form of acronyms such as DRA, IEP, and SOLs. Education has its own markets: Teachers Pay Teachers, Lakeshore Learning, Target (okay Target is for everyone, but teachers absolutely love Target). Education even has its own faux pas! Don’t ask a teacher to change her seating arrangement or give up her planning period.

As a teacher I knew these aspects of education inside and out. When I started making the jump to tech, I realized that I was no longer navigating familiar territory!
My hope is that as I document my leap into a new career, others who make the same leap won’t have to feel as lost and overwhelmed I as I first felt.

The first thing to do, if you are really serious about making the leap into the tech industry, is to create a LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a foreign concept for a lot of teachers. So here are some steps to take  as you enter the vast world of tech. This is not exhaustive. In fact, there is an entire industry of folks out there who make it their job to overhaul LinkedIn profiles for people. So, be kind to yourself and take it one step at a time.

#### So, you need a LinkedIn!

&nbsp;

If you aren’t a teacher and you are reading this, you might be surprised to find that teachers don’t really use LinkedIn! Sure, you can find teachers on LinkedIn. However, in the world of teaching, not having a LinkedIn won’t keep you from landing that dream teaching job.

If you are a teacher, though, and you are hoping to make the jump to tech, be ready to throw yourself full-force into LinkedIn! Priscilla Roman, a senior solution engineer at Salesforce, once told me, “LinkedIn is your living resume.” She’s absolutely right!

To get started with your LinkedIn try following these tips:

* Get a professional headshot: If you can’t pay for one, get a friend to take one. But whatever you do, do not use your school yearbook photo. Remember, you are trying to market yourself in a new industry. Using that yearbook photo practically screams, “I’m still a teacher!”
* Create your own banner: Your banner is the backdrop at the top of your LinkedIn page. It will show the world a little bit of your personality. Keep it professional, though. And, again, leave the chalkboard and apple themes behind. 

If you’re having trouble creating a banner, ChatGPT can actually create one for you! Try entering some of these statements into ChatGPT:

“Create a LinkedIn banner with a computers and plants theme”

“Create a data themed LinkedIn banner that uses the colors green and pink”

#### Put in your work experience.

&nbsp;

Okay, you dressed up your LinkedIn with a new photo and banner. Now start to slowly, but surely, add in your work experience.
When you are applying for jobs, your resume is going to be tailored to each job that you apply for. However, with your LinkedIn profile, you will want to keep things just a *tad* more general. This is because you never know who will land on your profile. It could be a health company or a law firm! You want to be able to appeal to a wide variety of employers.

This is a big job, so take your time and make sure you are happy with it. 

If you need some help with the teacher to tech lingo, here are some changes to get you started:

Students = Learners
Parents/Students = Stakeholders
Planning = Mapping
Testing = Data tracking
It’s all the things you’ve already been doing. You’re just putting it in terms that corporate hiring managers can understand.

#### Start networking.

&nbsp;

Okay, full disclosure: I am painfully introverted! Putting myself out there to strangers is uncomfortable! But if I’ve learned anything about people on LinkedIn so far, it’s that they are generally willing to connect (LinkedIn’s version of “friending”) with you! 

When you ask to connect, you might be prompted to send a note with your connection request. This note is just a short (200 characters or less) message to say “Hi!” Sending a note or message helps increase your chances of making the connection, although you won’t always need to go that extra step if you’re just reaching out to family and friends.

Then, consider joining a LinkedIn group. Once you see someone post something you like, reach out, give a compliment, and ask to connect. Here’s an example message you could send:
“Hi _______, I loved what you had to say in your post in the _______ group. I’ve been looking into this topic myself, I’m trying to learn more on the subject. I’d love see more of what you have to share. Hope we can connect!”

#### Don’t go it alone!

&nbsp;

Remember that you are not the only one on this journey! In fact, I’m traveling on this journey right now. In the summer of 2023, I started the Data Engineering course on Digital Air Force University/DataCamp. After gaining Python and SQL skills, I started working on the Salesforce Admin certificate in December 2023 and passed the certification exam on March 29, 2024. I’ve applied for some fellowships and am hoping to hear back soon. Meanwhile, I’m going to start working on the Salesforce Lightning App Developer modules. 

You’re writing, the first words of a new story, and who knows where it will take you?! It's a process, and it takes time, but I’m right here in the trenches with you. 

You aren’t alone.
