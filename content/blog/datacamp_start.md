### “I didn't start with the courage and confidence. I started with the risk.”

#### Laura Davies (British golfer)

The tech world is a huge world and there is so much advice out there. Sometimes it’s hard to know where to begin. If you want to go into development, you might find yourself asking these questions:

“Should I learn Python or SQL first?”

“Do I need to buy a second monitor so that I can get better at coding?”

“How do I access that black html screen that programmers use?”

“What is a shell?”

“What is Jupyter?”

“Why is Jupyter spelled incorrectly?”

&nbsp;

There are numerous resources and platforms that can be used to upskill or reskill. You could pay several thousand dollars and join a certification program through a university. You could find a local nonprofit that seeks to empower local citizens by providing opportunities for growth. You could listen to a youtuber who promises that if you just "follow these steps you're guaranteed to land a job in 1 month!" I'd actually strongly recommend staying suspicious of the validity of any such promises. Once you really start looking at all the choices, it can be overwhelming. However, if you are looking to get into programming languages, I have to recommend DataCamp. This is especially true if you are coming from the teaching industry, and you’ll see why.

&nbsp;

DataCamp follows the typical lesson format that educators are used to. Each lesson starts with direct instruction, usually a video. In education we would call this direct instruction, and it happens in the form of a mini-lesson! Followed by some guided practice either via answer sorting or multiple choice questions. Then, you apply your skills via DataCamp’s own interface. It looks like this:

The prompts are on the left, and you do your work on the right hand side. You receive immediate feedback on your performance and then, if you pass, you move on to the next question. Each lesson is scaffolded into manageable chunks that can be completed in just 15 or so minutes. Then, you move on to the next lesson!

&nbsp;

In a world where so much can feel so foreign, it is comforting to have some familiarity. The way the lessons are structured and the way they progress feels very easy and natural. To get started with DataCamp you do not need to download any special programs, you don’t need to buy a computer with a special processor, and you don’t have to do anything to build up a knowledge base before getting started. Also, DataCamp has numerous options to choose from when it comes to the path you want to take! I’ve been working through the Data Engineer career track. In just a few months, I went from not knowing what “structured query language” meant to writing my own subqueries.

&nbsp;

Best of all, each first chapter is free. And, at just $25 per month, DataCamp offers quality and affordability. Then, if you find that it isn’t working out, you can cancel at any time. I don’t get paid to endorse DataCamp, so it truly comes from the heart when I say, “go for it!” You don’t have to start with knowledge or confidence, you just have to take a risk.
